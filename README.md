# Autonomous-Navigating-and-2D-Mapping-Robot
Autonomous Navigating and 2D Mapping Robot using RC car

We use Soundwave Sensor as a radar.

We use Servo Motor to circulate a Soundwave Sensor.

Connect Arduino with Soundwave sensor & Servo Motor

Arduino will transfer distance data to Raspberry Pi.

Raspberry pi accept the data and Mapping on own coordinate.
